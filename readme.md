# First json-server built using ngrok and npm json server.

#### This server is made to support the react-native-blog-app available in repository. This will help the app go online and store the things in an online server so that whenever the app restarts, it will load the things already written. But the problem with ngrok is that we will have to reset the link generated by ngrok each time we restart the server. If we pay for that, then it would be okay. The code for the main app is hosted at https://github.com/ak2783934/Blog-App-React-Native
